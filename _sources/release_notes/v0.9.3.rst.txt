Koji Smoky Dingo preview 0.9.3 Release Notes
============================================

*October 02, 2020*

Chugging along and collecting feedback.

Some interesting new features are coming in Koji 1.23. In particular
we will be gaining the ability to block tag extra settings, and the
new block-env-var and block-rpm-macro commands expose that
behavior. This will also be the first version of koji which enables
the hub to report what version is running, so we've created the
version_check and version_require functions to gate behavior around
the koji hub version.

- add iter_bulk_load generator function
- fix exception in kojismokyding.cli.tabulate for None values
- rename unset-env-var to remove-env-var
- rename unset-rpm-macro to remove-rpm-macro
- added block-env-var and block-rpm-macro (requires koji 1.23)
- added FeatureUnavailable exception type
- updated list-tag-extras to add a '--blocked' option
- add ensure_tag function
- updated bulk-tag-builds to add a '--create' option
- add version_check and version_require functions
