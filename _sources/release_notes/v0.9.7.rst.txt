Koji Smoky Dingo preview 0.9.7 Release Notes
============================================

*March 10, 2021*

I hope that this will be the final preview release, with the next
version being the official 1.0.0. There may be some final API
adjustments (renaming, etc) but otherwise I am happy with the current
set of features.

Still chugging along!

- removed AllGroupPkgs tag sieve in favor of the GroupPkgs sieve with a
  new ``require_all:`` option
- removed `Sifter._convert_sym_aliases` in favor of using the aliases field
  on the `LogicNot` and `Flagged` sieves
- the `Sieve.check` method is no longer abstract, and by default returns
  `False` (ie. no results are included). This allows Sieve subclasses to
  opt to override the `run` method without having to still include an
  otherwise useless `check` implementation as well.
- added command ``bulk-untag-builds`` and related API
- added command ``bulk-move-builds`` and related API
- removed the ``--strict`` option from ``list-component-builds``
  command, checking of input NVRs is mandatory now
