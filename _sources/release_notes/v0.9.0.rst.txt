Koji Smoky Dingo preview 0.9.0 Release Notes
============================================

*September 03, 2020*

Welcome to the initial preview release of Koji Smoky Dingo!

This first release contains the following commands:

 - affected-targets
 - check-hosts
 - client-config
 - bulk-tag-builds
 - latest-archives
 - list-build-archives
 - list-cgs
 - list-env-vars
 - list-imported
 - list-rpm-macros
 - list-tag-extras
 - perminfo
 - renum-tag-inheritance
 - set-env-var
 - set-rpm-macro
 - swap-tag-inheritance
 - unset-env-var
 - unset-rpm-macro
 - userinfo

The project is broken up into two main installable pieces

 - kojismokydingo - The core library and plugin command handlers
 - kojismokydingo_meta - A Koji CLI plugin which acts as an adapter to
   python entry points

At this time, no API stability is guaranteed. Indeed it's expected
that many functions and commands may change their signatures or
names. Once the project reaches the goals for a version 1.0.0, it will
no longer be in preview mode, and at that point in time semantic
versioning rules will apply.
