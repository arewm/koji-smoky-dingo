Koji Smoky Dingo preview 0.9.1 Release Notes
============================================

*September 18, 2020*

This release merges the core library and the meta plugin together into
a single package. This means they can no longer be installed
independently.

ChangeLog:

- All 0.9.z versions are still considered API unstable, this just
  helps to differentiate snapshots
- Moved to a single distribution containing including the package and
  the metaplugin
- added new filter-builds and list-component-builds commands
- removed list-imported (behavior now available in filter-builds)
- slightly beefed up docs
- moved as_buildinfo, as_taginfo, as_targetinfo into the main
  kojismokydingo package
- decorate_build_archive_data is now idempotent and slightly less
  expensive
