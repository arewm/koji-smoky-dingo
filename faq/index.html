<p>Nobody actually asks these things. But if they did, these would be the
answers!</p>
<div class="section" id="what-s-the-purpose-of-this-project">
<h2>What's the Purpose of this Project?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-s-the-purpose-of-this-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I've worked with a Koji deployment on a nearly daily basis as part of
my job for more than a decade. Over that time I have collected a fair
number of scripts, aliases, and little tricks. This project represents
my attempt to coalesce that collection into a reusable set of features
that anyone else working with Koji can use.</p>
<p>The more I develop Koji Smoky Dingo, the more opportunities I've
realized for additional features. In a way, this project is the
manifestation of my own Koji wish list.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-is-it-called-koji-smoky-dingo">
<h2>Why Is It Called Koji Smoky Dingo?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-it-called-koji-smoky-dingo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Because project naming is a right pain in the butt. I ran through a
few 2-slugs from <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/coolname/">coolname</a> until
the words &quot;Smoky Dingo&quot; popped up, and that tickled my fancy so I went
with it.</p>
<p>You'll note a somewhat ridiculous adherence to that naming scheme in
the API. The base class for plugin commands is a <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SmokyDingo</span></code>. The
base exception class is a <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BadDingo</span></code>. A standalone command is a
<code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LonelyDingo</span></code>. The filtering mini-language is <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Sifty</span> <span class="pre">Dingo</span></code>. It makes
me happy.</p>
<p>Since the name &quot;Koji Smoky Dingo&quot; is fairly long, I frequently refer
to it as simply &quot;KSD&quot;.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-not-contribute-directly-to-koji">
<h2>Why Not Contribute Directly to Koji?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-not-contribute-directly-to-koji" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Because it's unreasonable to expect the Koji project to maintain some
of these ideas. In a few cases, sure a given command could have been a
good fit for the core client. However, the Koji project is
significantly more mature than Koji Smoky Dingo is. By remaining
separate I keep a level of freedom in how I implement the API and
features. I can smash together an idea quickly and get it committed
without having to prove my case to any core developers. The Koji
developers have to worry about feature creep, stale code, API
compatability, etc. As a totally separate entity, KSD can iterate very
fast to try and match my ever-changing vision of what an ideal
&quot;helper&quot; layer should look like.</p>
<p>When KSD finally reaches version 1.0.0, I will at that point have to
begin worrying about API stability. However even then I will still
have more flexibility than a project that has to worry about being a
critical component in the build infrastructure for so many
organizations. Therefore it's extremely likely that KSD will always
remain separate... but hopefully popular enough one day that any
advanced Koji user will also be a Koji Smoky Dingo user.</p>

<div class="section" id="why-is-there-an-entire-mini-language-in-here">
<h2>Why Is There An Entire Mini Language In Here?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-there-an-entire-mini-language-in-here" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I discovered that a number of my more complicated scripts were simply
taking a big collection of things (usually builds, but sometimes
tags), and trying to identify relationships or features to filter
through them. I'd custom craft these scripts to try and be as polite
to our Koji instance as possible -- using multicalls, only
authenticating if I was using an API that needed it, de-duplicating
and caching as much data as possible, etc. As I began to port these
scripts into KSD I began trying to imagine a better way to do work
with this sort of tooling. I wanted an easier way to write the sorts
of questions I was asking Koji, while simultaneously not making them
act rudely.</p>
<p>The idea came to me that I could produce a filtering and flagging
pipeline where individual predicates could be used in stages -- first
allowed to prepare for filtering by requesting the necessary data from
Koji all at once, and then applying that information to filter the set
of data elements. The trick would be to author logical combining
operators in such a way that they only invoked their nested predicates
with the elements that were truly relevant, slowly reducing the load
of lookups.</p>
<p>Having such a pipeline API would solve the problem of filtering from
within scripts, but what if I wanted to be able to supply filtering
options from the command-line?  What if that filtering was very
complicated?  Well, s-expressions are very easy to parse, and I've
written trivial (and admittedly somewhat crappy) parsers before for
other projects. One such past project was even used to serve a very
similar concept, filtering through bookmarks in the (now defunct)
del.icio.us service. So I took parts of that old parser and ported it
into what became Koji Sifty Dingo, an s-expression based predicate
language!</p>

<div class="section" id="why-do-you-still-support-python-2-6">
<h2>Why Do You Still Support Python 2.6?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-do-you-still-support-python-2-6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Because I use a number of hosts that have RHEL 6 on them, and I very
much want to be able to use Koji Smoky Dingo in those environments.</p>
<p>As much as people complain about Python 2, it feels pretty darn
trivial to support older versions. Even when these hosts get upgraded
to newer versions of RHEL or CentOS, I will mostly likely maintain
backwards compatibility for a pretty long time. The only feature I
truly yearn for is syntactic changes in Python 3 where keyword-only
arguments can be expressed after variadic positionals. I'd really
prefer to use that in the Sieve API instead of the <code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set_options</span></code>
method. Once everything is RHEL 8 and above I'll probably consider
dropping Python 2 support just for that.</p>
<p>Honestly, the biggest struggle has been in working with multiple
versions of Koji. Or working with multiple versions of libraries under
Python 3 to dodge the deprecation churn.</p>
<p>Once KSD achieves a version 1.0.0 I will begin work on 2.0.0 which
will drop Python 2 support. I'm not sure how long I'll provide
backports to the 1.0 line after that... it likely depends on how long
I have to use a RHEL 6 machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-version-0-9">
<h2>Why Version 0.9?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-version-0-9" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I like to use a major version of 0 and a minor version of 9 to
indicate an unstable API. I use the micro version value to indicate
the individual snapshots along the way.</p>
<p>There's no good reasoning behind the minor version of 9, it just
happened. I picked up the habit of using 0.9 for projects where I'd be
fine with people using it but where I wanted to caution them against
relying on it too heavily. I never spent too much time analyzing any
deeper meaning behind the numbers. Fear of commitment maybe? Dunno.</p>
<p>When I do finally decide it's time to become stable (when all the
features I want are present, I've got more code coverage in my unit
tests, and there's been more exposure for the project via daily use by
more people) I will cut a version 1.0.0 and adopt semantic versioning
from there on out. Until then I will try to exercise some restraint
but all API is fair game to get tweaked and scrambled.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-i-write-my-own-tools-on-top-of-koji-smoky-dingo">
<h2>Can I Write My Own Tools On Top of Koji Smoky Dingo?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-i-write-my-own-tools-on-top-of-koji-smoky-dingo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You absolutely can. There's an examples directory which highlights how
to use it to create your own scripts, commands, and custom sieve
predicates. But be forewarned by the answer to the previous question
-- until version 1.0.0 is released there will likely be some level of
API churn that could introduce compatibility issues for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-i-get-involved">
<h2>Can I Get Involved?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-i-get-involved" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It's open source software, you don't have to ask! File an RFE, fork
the project on GitHub, write the code you want to see in the world,
and submit a PR. If you have questions about how things work we can
communicate in the tracker.</p>
<p>I'd also be happy to receive patches or pull requests for
documentation and unit tests.</p>
<p>No hate though, you keep that stuff in your tummy.</p>
